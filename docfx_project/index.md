# ProcessMemoryUtilities.Net

## What is ProcessMemoryUtilities.Net?

ProcessMemoryUtilities.Net implements performant wrapper methods over, in game hacking, commonly used NtDll and Kernel32 functions. The different classes allow you to use generic type parameters with ReadProcessMemory and WriteProcessMemory and call simpler functions like OpenProcess, CreateRemoteThread and more without any overhead.
